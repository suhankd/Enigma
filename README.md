**Enigma Cipher C++ implementation**

This project is a C++ simulation of the famous Enigma Machine used for encrypting and decrypting messages during World War II. 
The program mimics the functionality of the Enigma by using rotors, reflectors, plugboards, and a keyboard, which are all encapsulated in custom classes

The code consists of a keyboard, plugboard, reflector, and 5 rotors, the first 3 of which follow the wiring of the Enigma-1, introduced in 1930, and the the next were introduced in 1938 as part of the M3-Army class.

I understood the architecture and the propogation of signals through these pages : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine
